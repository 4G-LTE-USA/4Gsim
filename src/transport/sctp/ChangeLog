    * modified and implemented the method to create a SCTP socket 
      from a message (SCTPSocket(cMessage *msg)). The method is similar 
      with the one from TCP model.
      
    * corrected a bug in send on path method of SCTP association 
      (SCTPAssociationSendAll.cc line 663). The method should
      return if there is no data to be sent.
